# General Style

## Acronyms, Abbreviations and Initialisms

Definition fields should spell out acronyms, abbreviations and initialisms for clarity and to avoid confusion (e.g. CAD as coronary artery disease vs. computer assisted diagnosis). It is not necessary to spell out standard units of measurement, such as cm. 

Set and Element names may include commonly used acronyms, abbreviations and initialisms. Those that are less common should be spelled out. 

Be careful not to coin new abbreviations for terms that already have a standard. Ex. hepatocellular carcinoma is commonly abbreviated as “HCC” in the literature; do not use “HC” for the same term.

## Medical Eponyms

Per AMA standards, eliminate possessive forms of medical eponyms (medical terms named after people). Ex "Crohn's disease" should be "Crohn disease".
